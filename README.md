The command `create_dummy_data` creates an user with email `dummy@law-orga.de` and password `qwe123`. You can use it to login into the development frontend.

### Server Setup

You might want to look into the following file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. This workflow file tests the application
and afterwards it builds and pushes the image into a docker registry. From that registry you can deploy the image to the
hoster of your choice. Some environment variables need to be set within the running environment.
